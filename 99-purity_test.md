# Purity Test

## Editor's note

_The "purity text" originally included in the section [Survival in the Tute](07-survival.md) has been moved here._

_According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purity_test), purity tests were among the earliest memes and popular on Usenet in the early 1980s, around the same time that the NtRH was originally written._

_The content may contain language or viewpoints that may be offensive or insensitive by current-day standards. The text is included here for historical reasons, but it is not necessary for understanding the NtRH._

## The Unabridged Purity Test
